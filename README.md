# Hi, I’m Al‑ameen Adesina 👋

👀 Thank you for stopping by my space — this is where I grow, build, and share my journey in cybersecurity and tech!

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into Cybersecurity, Governance, Strategy, Linux, Automation, Python, and ISO 27001. I enjoy creating structure, solving problems, and helping people — whether through tech, process, or collaboration.

💼 I’m actively shaping my path toward consulting, governance, risk, and strategy roles. Every project, event, and certification is an opportunity to sharpen my craft.

🎓 I’ve been engaging with the community through events like **BFUTR 2025**, where I connected with tech leaders, cybersecurity professionals, and innovators who inspire my growth.
